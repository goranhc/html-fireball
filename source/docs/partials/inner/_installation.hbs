        Get started with <b>PaniniTemplate Template</b> which is extended version of Bootstrap, the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites,
        with predefined styles and a template starter page. While this is extended Bootstrap 4 template we avoid to overwrite default
        utilities or components. If you are already familiar with Bootstrap syntax, you're ready to go. All upgrades with advanced and
        premium features are explained in following documentation so please use the side menu to navigate the documentation.

        Also for javascript plugins you should include mandatory libraries. Many of our components
        require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require jQuery, and
        JavaScript plugins. Our <code>bootstrap.bundle.js</code> and <code>bootstrap.bundle.min.js</code>
        includes Popper.js. For more info about <code>popper.js</code> read more on
        <a href="https://popper.js.org/" target="_blank">this link</a>.

    <figcaption>Starter template</figcaption>
    <p>For building your own template we prepare the starter template code. Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards.
